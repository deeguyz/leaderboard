Hey,

I'm Christopher Powroznik, CEO of Frame One Software. We're thrilled about the prospect of you joining our team as a UI/UX Designer. I'd like to invite you to an initial interview to delve into your design background, experiences, and to get to know each other a bit better.

This conversation will be a 45-minute chat, where we'll explore your educational and professional journey, and discuss what excites you about the design world. It's a great opportunity for us to understand your career aspirations and how they align with our goals at Frame One Software.

To schedule this meeting, please use the following Calendly link: https://calendly.com/d/3xd-7vv-sdr/designer-interview-with-frame-one-software. I recommend booking a slot at your earliest convenience.

The initial meeting will be an opportunity for us to get acquainted and discuss your background. Following this, if the initial interview goes well, you'll be given a creative task to complete at home, allowing us to see your approach to design challenges.

If you have any questions or need more information before our meeting, feel free to reply to this email.

Looking forward to our chat and the potential of you being part of our team at Frame One Software!

Regards,
Christopher Powroznik
