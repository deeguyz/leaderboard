I'm Christopher Powroznik, CEO of Frame One Software. We're thrilled about the prospect of you joining our team as a Full Stack Developer. I'd like to invite you to an initial interview to delve into your background, experiences, and to simply get to know each other a bit better.

This conversation will be a 30-minute chat, where we'll explore your educational and professional journey, and discuss what excites you about the tech world. It's a great opportunity for us to understand your career aspirations and how they align with our goals at Frame One Software.

To schedule this meeting, please use the following Calendly link: https://calendly.com/d/3km-9mc-8fq/interview-at-frame-one-software. I recommend booking a slot at your earliest convenience.

Please note that our interview process is conducted in two stages. The initial meeting will be an opportunity for us to get acquainted and discuss your background. If this goes well, we'll invite you to a second, more technical interview, where we'll dive deeper into your technical skills and problem-solving abilities.

If you have any questions or need more information before our meeting, feel free to reply to this email.

Looking forward to our chat and the potential of you being part of our team at Frame One Software!
